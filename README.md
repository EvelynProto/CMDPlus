# CMDPlus
CMDPlus is a lightweight python command prompt emulator, with a couple of improved features.
## Why?
CMDPlus has slightly enhanced user interface, such as:
* Proper error reporting.
* Counters using TQDM for deleting files and such.
* Simple command aliasing
* Intuitive settings file.
* Simplistic GUI.

CMDPlus has the bonus on being able to be used on systems with Command Prompt disabled, but not batch scripts.
### Requirements

* (RECOMMENDED) PySimpleGUI
* (OPTIONAL) TQDM
### Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. (RECOMMENDED) Install PySimpleGUI, using pip or other means.
3. (OPTIONAL) Install TQDM, using pip or other means.
4. Run the Python file, CMDPlusStarter.py
