# CMDPlus
CMDPlus is a lightweight python command prompt emulator, with a couple of improved features.
## Why?
CMDPlus has slightly enhanced user interface, such as:
> Proper error reporting.

> Counters using TQDM for deleting files and such.

CMDPlus has the bonus on being able to be used on systems with Command Prompt disabled, but not batch scripts.
### Requirements
> Python 3.7+
> (OPTIONAL) TQDM
### Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. (OPTIONAL) Install TQDM, using pip or other means.
3. Run the Python file, CMDPlus.py
